Pssst. There is a way to bypass the congestion along I-10 East at Sunland. Just take the Sunland flyover ramp to connect directly to US 85 East. It will lead you to Executive Center as well as Downtown. (Not even Google Maps knows about it yet) @txdotelp @EpDistrict1 @ElPasoTXGov,GO10EP,0

"The @HyundaiSA 1.0 litre Grand i10 goes for R165,000 (R174k with delivery costs). Let's work this out in reverse: Residual Value R35k Interest 5.5% 72 months Deposit R25,525.00 You get an instalment of R2006.60! So #IssaPossible! See pic for her numbers. Not okay.",AtheistZulu,1
"So I visited @HyundaiSA Weltevreden. They are advertising R1999 pm on a R165k 1.0litre Grand i10. Well, finance manager says, ""There is no such, the ad just to draws clients in."" She says R2,985.00 pm at 12% int rate. This is obviously not okay. #IssaThread. . .",AtheistZulu,1
